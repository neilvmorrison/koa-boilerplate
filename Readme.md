# Koa Boilerplate

This is a restful boilerplate using KoaJS that comes built with Mongoose and Koa-Router.

## How to Use

1. Create routes in the route folder.
2. Import those routes into the routes/index.js file, then export them in the combineRouters() function.
3. Use services to conduct business logic.
4. Interact with those services in the router handlers.
